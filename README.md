# Offline fallback shelly zha control

This project aims to provide an offline fallback option for controlling a zha lamp using a shelly. In the event that zha or the network goes offline, the Shelly switch will automatically trigger its relay to toggle the light. When the network is online, the switch will use zha to directly control the light, preserving the smooth fade effect of compatible lamps.
